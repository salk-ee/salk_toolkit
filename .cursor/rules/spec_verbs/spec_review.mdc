description: How to review a spec before (and during) implementation

## Workflow

Review the spec for the following:

**Sufficiency**
- Does the spec contain enough information to implement the feature
  - Add missing context as needed
- Is the itemized todo list sufficient to lead to that implementation
  - Add any missing steps as new tasks
- Is the **Definition of done** up to date and is it sufficient to check the feature

**Consistency**
- Is it consistent with the style required in [specs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/specs.mdc)
- Is it internally consistent, i.e. does not contradict itself
- Move things around and clean as needed to make it consistent
- Are links to other files and specs up-to-date?

**Concision**
- Can any sentences be shortened without losing important information
- Is there anything irrelevant to the feature at hand
- Is there anything written that is covered by relevant domains rules already
  - Domain rules (as laid out in included .mdc files) do not need to be repeated
- Is any information duplicated in multiple places
- Clean up everything that is unnecessary and make spec as short as possible
  - Re-structure things as needed to achieve this

**Reflects current state**
- If some tasks are marked as done, check if that is indeed true
- Then check the next few tasks to see if they have been started
  - If yes, make a note of that under the tasks
  - Report everything you failed to validate

Iterate the spec until it fills all the above criteria

**BE ADVERSARIAL**
- Assume the spec was written by a lazy idiot that was half-asleep that we all hate
- If something sounds weird, out of place, or unclear, check it and clarify with user as needed
- Constructive criticism is expected in this phase - DO NOT HOLD BACK
