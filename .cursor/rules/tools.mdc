# Tools

## Overview
- Tools are meant as command-line-accessible utilities that help in using the library core functions

## Location
- For simple, short functionalities, add them to `nbs/11_commands.ipynb` under their own MD heading
- For more involved tools, create a dedicated file to `salk_toolkit/tools/{tool}.py`

## Execution
- All tools should be added to `settings.ini` to make them command-line accessible on installing the package
- On calling, they should have a prefix `stk_` to avoid overwriting other commands in an environment

## Best practice
- Each larger tool should have a [spec](](mdc:.cursor/rules/specs.mdc)) describing its expected functionality for developers to refer back to as needed.
  - Specs for tools start with TOOL instead of DEV
  - NB: Always read the spec for the tool before making any changes to it!
  - The spec should be kept up-to-date as the tool is updated and changed
- For tools that require a UI, use `streamlit`

## Main existing tools
- **Explorer** (`salk_toolkit/tools/explorer.py`) - Exploratory data analysis tool
  - Built on top of the Plotting functionality
- **Translate Dashboard** (in `nbs/11_commands.ipynb`) - Command-line tool to easily translate dashboards
  - Translates the .pot files generated by dashboards using deepl API
