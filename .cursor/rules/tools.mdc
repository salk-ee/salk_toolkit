# Tools

## Overview
- Tools are meant as command-line-accessible utilities that help in using the library core functions

## Location
- CLI entry points live in `salk_toolkit/commands.py`
- Streamlit and other substantial tools live under `salk_toolkit/tools/{tool}.py`

## Execution
- All tools should be added to `settings.ini` to make them command-line accessible on installing the package
- On calling, they should have a prefix `stk_` to avoid overwriting other commands in an environment

## Best practice
- Each larger tool should have a [spec](](mdc:.cursor/rules/specs.mdc)) describing its expected functionality for developers to refer back to as needed.
  - Specs for tools start with TOOL instead of DEV
  - NB: Always read the spec for the tool before making any changes to it!
  - The spec should be kept up-to-date as the tool is updated and changed
- For tools that require a UI, use `streamlit`

## Main existing tools
- **Explorer** (`salk_toolkit/tools/explorer.py`) - Exploratory data analysis tool built on top of the plotting pipeline
- **Translate Dashboard** (wired up in `salk_toolkit/commands.py`) - CLI helper that translates dashboard `.pot` files via the Deepl API
