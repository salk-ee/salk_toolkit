## Workflow

- Go down the list of tasks
  - Task is an item with a checkmark box in front of it
  - Verify each has been implemented according to requirements and add check if warranted
  - Pay special attention to "Definition of Done" section
- Check that the completed tasks solve the initial problem that was set out
- If everything is indeed done, mark the spec status as "Completed"
  - Otherwise flag what is still left to do and uncheck tasks/add new ones as needed
