# Annotator

A tool to edit data annotations

Annotation data structure is defined in `../validation.py`

# Architectural principles
- `master_meta` should reflect current state
  - when loading a view, all values should be reloaded from there fresh
  - when state is changed, it should change the master_meta and then reload 
  - where possible, this should be achieved by `wrap`-ing the `st` inputs
- Each main view should have it's own file
  - shared functions in `framework.py`
